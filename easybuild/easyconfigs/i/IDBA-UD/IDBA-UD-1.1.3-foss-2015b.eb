description = """ IDBA-UD is a iterative De Bruijn Graph De Novo Assembler for Short Reads 
 Sequencing data with Highly Uneven Sequencing Depth. It is an extension of IDBA algorithm. 
 IDBA-UD also iterates from small k to a large k. In each iteration, short and low-depth 
 contigs are removed iteratively with cutoff threshold from low to high to reduce the errors 
 in low-depth and high-depth regions. Paired-end reads are aligned to contigs and assembled 
 locally to generate some missing k-mers in low-depth regions. With these technologies, IDBA-UD 
 can iterate k value of de Bruijn graph to a very large value with less gaps and less branches 
 to form long contigs in both low-depth and high-depth regions."""
