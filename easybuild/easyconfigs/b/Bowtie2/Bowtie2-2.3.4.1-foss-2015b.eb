description = """ Bowtie 2 is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads 
 to long reference sequences. It is particularly good at aligning reads of about 50 up to 100s or 1,000s 
 of characters, and particularly good at aligning to relatively long (e.g. mammalian) genomes. 
 Bowtie 2 indexes the genome with an FM Index to keep its memory footprint small: for the human genome, 
 its memory footprint is typically around 3.2 GB. Bowtie 2 supports gapped, local, and paired-end alignment modes."""

#
# Bowtie2 does not have a proper configure to figure out where tbb library is located and
# tbb does not have a proper pkgconfig, which EasyBuild can pick up automagically 
# to configure the build environment correctly. As a workaround we use the combination of
#  * a patched Bowtie2 Makefile which introduces the TBBLIBDIR environment variable
#    to point to the correct location of the tbb libs.
#  * EasyConfig prebuildopts with some bash to parse the path to the tbb libs 
#    from the LD_LIBRARY_PATH env var. This path contains the glibc version numbers 
#    as well as the Linux kernel version and hence will vary on allmost every server 
#    making it impossible to add it hardcoded to the patched Makefile.
